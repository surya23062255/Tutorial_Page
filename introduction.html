                <h1><b>What is Computer ??</b></h1>
                <p>Computer is an electronic data processing device, which accept and store data input and generate the
                    output in a required format. The word "Computer" is extended form of the word "Compute", i.e., to
                    Calculate. It can perform the arthemetic operations at fast speed.</p>
                <hr>

                <h2>Types of Computer</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Analog Computer</b></li>
                    <li><b>Digital Computer</b></li>
                    <li><b>Hybrid Computer</b></li>
                </ol>
                <hr>

                <h2><b>Analog Computer</b></h2>
                <p>In analog computers, constant quantities are used. Calculations are done with physical quantities
                    like
                    voltage, length, current etc. Instruments measuring such quantities are analog instruments like
                    voltmeter, ammeter. The analog computer operates by measuring rather than counting. The main
                    advantage
                    is that all the calculations happen in parallel and hence, they are fast. Analog computers are
                    mostly
                    used in medical science.</p>
                <hr>


                <h2><b>Digital Computer</b></h2>
                <p>Digital computers work on discrete data. They convert the data into digits (binary digits) and all
                    operations are performed on these digital at extremely fast rate. A digital computer basically knows
                    how to count the digits and add up the digits. Digital computers are much faster and far more
                    accurate than analog computers. Computers used for business and scientific applications are digital
                    computers.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3><b>The Digital Computers are classified into four categories.</b></h3>
                <h4><b><u>Micro Computer</u></b></h4>
                <p>A microcomputer is one whose CPU is a microprocessor. These are typically single-microprocessor,
                    single user-systems designed to perform basic operations such as educational, training, small
                    business applications, etc. They are mainly used for offices, homes, schools, etc. Microcomputer is
                    a complete computer on a smaller scale and is usually a synonym for the more general term 'personal
                    computer'.</p>
                <hr>

                <h4><b><u>Mini Computer</u></b></h4>
                <p>Minicomputer also called mid-range server, a term no longer used much, is a computer of a size
                    intermediate between a microcomputer and a mainframe computer. Typically minicomputers are
                    stand-alone computers sold to small and medium-sized businesses for general business applications
                    and large enterprises for department-level operations. In recent years minicomputers have evolved
                    into 'mid-range servers' and are part of a network.</p>
                <hr>

                <h4><b><u>Mainframe Computer</u></b></h4>
                <p>Mainframe computer is an industry term for a large computer. It is manufactured by a big company like
                    IBM. A mainframe computer is large but not as large as a supercomputer and has more processing power
                    than some other classes of computers, such as minicomputers and personal computers. Most large-scale
                    computer-system architectures were established in the 1960s. Mainframe computers are often used as
                    servers.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h4><b><u>Super Computer</u></b></h4>
                <p>Supercomputers are the most powerful computers as compared to other computers. Many processors run
                    simultaneously in these, making them extremely fast and powerful. These computers are capable of
                    handling large amounts of computation that are beyond human capability. They perform billions of
                    instructions per second.
                </p>
                <h4><b><u>Note :-</u></b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>India's first Super Computer is <b><i>PARAM-10000</i></b></li>
                    <li>World's first Super Computer is <b><i>CRAY-1</i></b></li>
                </ul>

                <hr>


                <h2><b>Hybrid Computer</b></h2>
                <p>Hybrid computers utilize the best qualities of both digital and analog computers. Some of these
                    calculations are done in an analog way and the rest of them are done in a digital way. Hybrid
                    computers are used in weather forecasting.</p>

                <hr>

                <h1><b>Characteristics of Computer</b></h1>
                <h4><b><u>Speed</u></b></h4>
                <p>Computer is a very fast device. It can calculate data at very high speed. Computer speed is measured
                    in
                    terms of microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds, etc. For example, a microcomputer can execute
                    millions
                    of instructions per second, but a supercomputer executes instructions millions of times faster than
                    a
                    microcomputer.</p>

                <h4><b><u>Storage Capacity</u></b></h4>
                <p>Computers can store large amounts of data and information for a very long time. It can store any type
                    of
                    data and information. Its memory system has two types of memory as main memory and auxiliary memory.
                    Auxiliary storage devices are secondary storage devices of a computer system.</p>

                <h4><b><u>Accuracy</u></b></h4>
                <p>Computer system is a highly consistent machine. Its accuracy is much higher than that of humans. It
                    can
                    calculate at almost 100% accuracy. All the operations are to be conducted by a computer with the
                    same
                    accuracy. Errors can occur in a computer system, but only because of incorrect human input data or
                    incorrect programming code.</p>

                <h4><b><u>Versatility</u></b></h4>
                <p>Computer systems are very versatile machines. The most amazing feature of a computer system is that
                    it
                    can perform a variety of different activities, from simple calculations to complex scientific
                    operations
                    and is also capable of preparing the examination marksheets, bills etc. They can also communicate
                    with
                    each other to send and receive data. In short, a computer is capable of performing any task.</p>

                <h4><b><u>Diligence</u></b></h4>
                <p>Diligence means free from monotony, exhaustion, lack of concentration. Due to this quality, the
                    computer
                    can work for many hours without any errors. Human beings have feelings like sadness, depression,
                    carelessness etc. These feelings and weakness affect the work done by man. A computer can perform
                    the
                    same tasks again and again with the same accuracy because there is no human weakness in the
                    computer.
                </p>

                <h4><b><u>Automation</u></b></h4>
                <p>For a particular task, the computer does not depend on the user, it automatically forwards the tasks
                    in
                    the forward direction till its completion. Computers can be easily programmed to perform a range of
                    tasks as per the requirements. The computer automatically executes these instructions sequentially.
