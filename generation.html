            <p>Computers are classified between generations based on their developmental age. Different technologies
                were used to develop different types of computers. According to the type of 'processor' installed in a
                machine, there are five generations of computers.</p>

                <p>Second generation computers used <b><u>Transistors</u></b> in place of vacuum tubes. Transistors are
                    made of
                    semiconductor materials such as germanium and silicon. With the use of transistors computers became

                <h2><b>Third Generation (1965 - 1971) : Integrated Circuit</b></h2>
                <p>Third generation computers were based on integrated circuit (IC) technology. The IC replaced many
                    individually wired transistors. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable and
                    efficient. The second generation computers were much smaller in size and were much faster than the
                    previous generation computers. Instead of punched cards and printouts, the user interacted with
                    third-generation computers and interfaced with the operating system via keyboard and monitor.

                    <li>Hardware on third-generation computers rarely failed, so maintenance costs were also

                    computers. In
                    the fourth generation, computers became smaller and cheaper than other generation computers. Fourth

                    series of "what-if-then" analyses. These are the development objectives of the fifth generation of

                        chips, resulting in the production of microprocessors that contain millions of electronics
                        components on a single chip. Mega chips could enable computers to approximate the memory
                        capacity of the human mind.</li>
                    <li><b>Parallel Processing :</b> Computers with one processor access execute only one instruction at
                        a time. This is called Serial Processing. However, fifth generation computers would use multiple
                        processors and perform parallel processing, allowing multiple instructions to be accessed and
                        worked on at the same time.</li>

                        simulate and reproduce human behavior, including thinking, speaking, and reasoning. AI includes
                        a set of related technologies: expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition,
